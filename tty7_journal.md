# Feb 19 - 4h
We spent most of the time figuring out what we'll do for the project and doing some basic component research and part sourcing. It's a very ambitious project, timing will be super tight (and money too...). We decided on the linear rails
I got a quick mockup of the frame done, it's looking pretty cool right now:

I also did tons and tons of part sourcing and research especially on the frame components and motion system (not corexy stuff yet, that's a whole other beast that we're not ready for yet):
